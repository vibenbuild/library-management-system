# Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System built with **MySQL** to manage books, members, and transactions in a library. It helps keep track of books, allows members to borrow and return books, and ensures the availability of books is updated. This project demonstrates basic database operations using MySQL.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Insert new books into the library catalog.
- **Register Members**: Add new members who can borrow books.
- **Track Borrowed Books**: Record transactions when books are borrowed and returned.
- **Update Book Availability**: Manually update the availability of books when borrowed or returned.
- **View Borrowed Books**: Check the list of books borrowed by a specific member.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: Database for storing books, members, and transactions.
- **SQL Queries**: Basic queries to manage the library data.

## Future Improvements

- Add a **user interface** (front-end) to interact with the system.
- Implement features like **overdue book tracking**, **fine calculation**, and **searching books by category**.
- Expand the project to include **APIs** for better interaction with the system.
